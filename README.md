# Adam Kiryk Website

This still is still in progress. Latest steps taken were:

* Basic CSS styling
* Playing around with scrollmagic.js
* Used bodymovin.js but didn't love how the animations looked.

Next steps:

* Finish writing up work examples
* Create a design for work examples
* Use the entire width of screen rather than only the center part
* Create transitions with scrollmagic and greensock (or possibly anime.js)
* See 'curriculum' on drive for examples of sites that include transitions
* Check branch. Use master branch to push site live
